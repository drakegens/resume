    <p class="lead">Hello, I am Drake Gens - software engineer at Service Management Group in Kansas City!</p>
    <p>Check out my <a href="https://github.com/drakegens">GitHub repository</a> and feel free to contact me.</p>

    <p>
      I am currently working for <a href="https://www.smg.com/">SMG</a> in Kansas City, MO. I am utilizing C#, SQL
      Server, Javascript and AngularJS for client specific requests, internal tool development and production database
      changes.

      My previous job was at <a href="https://www.cerner.com/">Cerner</a>, where I was primarily a Java developer on the
      Clinical Reporting team. I also utilized technologies such as XSLT and CCL (Cerner Command Language) to fix
      defects and create new enhancements for a set of medical report generation products.
      This included Java RCP desktop applications and a Java web server built on IBM Websphere. I learned and used
      version control (SVN/GIT), Maven, and Jenkins to build and maintain continuous integration.
    </p>
    <p>I attended Truman State University, in Kirksville, MO, for my bachelors degree in computer science. During my
      college years, I interned at <a href="https://www.magellanhealth.com/">Magellan</a> in Maryland Heights, MO and
      Cerner in Kansas City, MO.</p>
    <p>
      I was the Vice President of Truman's local ACM chapter. During my time in office, I helped to implement the
      universities first hackathon as well as several programming competitions. I also tutored several computer science
      classes and was a volunteer for <a href="https://www.tealsk12.org/">TEALS</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also enjoy playing video games, running and reading in my free time.
